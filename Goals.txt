Brush up on vector math for bullet movement (wall bounce)
Basic enemies
  walking dudes?
bullets and damage mechanics (semi done)
  knockback (needs variable force)
UI and interface or whatever they're called (partially done)

player attack
  Melee attack exists, needs some limitations implemented to prevent spamming
    combos?
level loading, like from a file (it's done for now, but will need updating in the future)
maybe level editor if i feel like it




Done stuff
Move menu things from main to MenuState
Create a texture vector pointer thingy to pass to all the children in the land so they may have textures
Create a somewhat functioning PlayState
finish Createing a virtual gameobject to function as a parent for everything
a background object is just a texture thou and textures already exist...
Create a moving player object
floor and walls and ceiling
Collision basics, definitely
colliding with two walls is kinda fixed atm
remember to add the proper parts to the constructor silly
hazard collision basics are done
spike are kind of done i guess, just some damage mechanics are missing
move the hazard collision to somewhere other than the movement
camera movement
animations
  create an animation object that autoruns through the frames
  make a counter(s) similar to iframes and sync that up with the current action
Basic enemies
  Turrets
Fixed boundary collisions sometimes not registering due to double inaccuracy
jumping and gravity

Discarded ideas:
slopes: not making them, figurev em out later for other projects
