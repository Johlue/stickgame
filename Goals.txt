colliding with two walls is kinda broken atm
IDEA: Create a vector containing the shortest distance boundary in each direction and solve those separtely
slopes
Basic enemies
bullets and damage mechanics





Done stuff
Move menu things from main to MenuState
Create a texture vector pointer thingy to pass to all the children in the land so they may have textures
Create a somewhat functioning PlayState
finish Createing a virtual gameobject to function as a parent for everything
a background object is just a texture thou and textures already exist...
Create a moving player object
floor and walls and ceiling
Collision basics, definitely
