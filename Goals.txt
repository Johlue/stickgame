Brush up on vector math for bullet movement
Basic enemies
  turrets?
  walking dudes?
bullets and damage mechanics
UI and interface or whatever they're called (partially done)
slopes
jumping and gravity
player attack
level loading, like from a file
maybe level editor if i feel like it




Done stuff
Move menu things from main to MenuState
Create a texture vector pointer thingy to pass to all the children in the land so they may have textures
Create a somewhat functioning PlayState
finish Createing a virtual gameobject to function as a parent for everything
a background object is just a texture thou and textures already exist...
Create a moving player object
floor and walls and ceiling
Collision basics, definitely
colliding with two walls is kinda fixed atm
remember to add the proper parts to the constructor silly
hazard collision basics are done
spike are kind of done i guess, just some damage mechanics are missing
move the hazard collision to somewhere other than the movement, cause right now standing in a laser would be harmless as long as you don't move
camera movement
