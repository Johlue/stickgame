Basic enemies
  walking dudes
    things left to do:
      various AIs
        attack type (melee or ranged)
          melee:
    flying robot things?
      make them killable (some of them anyway) visual indicator for unkillable ones
UI and interface or whatever they're called (partially done)

turns out you can actually rotate textures in sdl, so that's nice
player attack
  Melee attack exists
    combos?
  Getting rid of that super lazer, as much as I like it it's kinda crappy
level loading, like from a file (it's done for now, but will need updating in the future)
Level Editor, I feel like it
  Loading and Saving
Switches
  floor standable switches

Graphics
  Player
    Sword hand animations
    Fix bullet spawn location to be at the gun barrel
  Enemys
    Walky dood
      Gun and aiming
      Melee weapon animations
    Turret
      Damage indicator
      invincibility indicator
      different barrels for different shot types
        an actual spinning blade graphic
  Objects
    Boundary
    Hazard

Custom keybindings ( should be relatively easy? )

Level design
Boss fights




Done stuff
Move menu things from main to MenuState
Create a texture vector pointer thingy to pass to all the children in the land so they may have textures
Create a somewhat functioning PlayState
finish Createing a virtual gameobject to function as a parent for everything
a background object is just a texture thou and textures already exist...
Create a moving player object
floor and walls and ceiling
Collision basics, definitely
colliding with two walls is kinda fixed atm
remember to add the proper parts to the constructor silly
hazard collision basics are done
spike are kind of done i guess, just some damage mechanics are missing
move the hazard collision to somewhere other than the movement
camera movement
animations
  create an animation object that autoruns through the frames
  make a counter(s) similar to iframes and sync that up with the current action
Basic enemies
  Turrets
    walking dudes
      knockback / flinching
      walkers can walk and fall
        some kind of attack (ranged guys shoot now)
        a way to detect the player (done-ish)
        various AIs
          attack type (melee or ranged)
            melee:
              same back and forth walking as normal and same "find the player AI"
              after the players been found thou they will instead increase in speed and start moving towards the player
              after the player is within range they will try to hit him with a melee
              some AI types may also jump
          walking type (stand still or not)
    flying robot things?
      make them killable (some of them anyway)
      make different AI types for turrets
        accurate: the current AI shoots at an equal fire rate straight at the player
        semi-spread: shoots faster, but is less accurate, some randomness in aiming
        full spread: basically a shotgun shoots a lot of bullets at once and at varying angles and speeds
        ITS BEYBLADE!: spinny blades that tries to charge at you

        stationary: floats in place
        flight: flies around, doesn't go through walls - donzo
        groundspin: moves across the ground in the players direction
        noclip: flies thru walls and follows player forever
Fixed boundary collisions sometimes not registering due to double inaccuracy
jumping and gravity
Player attack
  melee done
  Shots
    aiming is just diagonals and straight lines
  gigalazer
    chargeup is Done
    actual laze code thou?
      multiple line collision checks? probs yeah
bullets and damage mechanics
  knockback (has variable force)
Level loader
Level Editor
  add some kind of object editor menu to, well edit objects
      DROPDOWNMENU OPTIONS ARE IN func
    drop down menu for things that have multiple choices
      Actually adding various objects to the objects list
      maybe shapes of boundary objects
  creating objects
    boundaries / other
  put a string on all objects that has the necessary data (e.g. 250 111 RANGED INSTANTTURN)
    maybe a second string to tell you what the first strings parameters mean?(X Y combatAI walkAI)
    render these to screen for editing
    could also make an array of (String String typeofdata) objects instead of multiple strings
  object editor menu
  some text editing thing for numbers
Switches
  only once
  auto deactivating
  and regular types

make text textures

Discarded ideas:
slopes: not making them, figurev em out later for other projects
