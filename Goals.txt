Brush up on vector math for bullet movement (wall bounce)
Basic enemies
  walking dudes
    walkers can walk and fall
    things left to do:
      some kind of attack
      a way to detect the player (done-ish)
      various AIs
        attack type (melee or ranged)
        walking type (stand still or not)
    flying robot things?
bullets and damage mechanics (semi done)
  knockback (needs variable force)
UI and interface or whatever they're called (partially done)

player attack
  Melee attack exists
    combos?
  Shots
    big-ass fricking lazer beam?
    some sort of aiming system, probs just arrow keys, but maybe some sort of "stand still and aim" thing? could also just add mouse-aim
level loading, like from a file (it's done for now, but will need updating in the future)
Level Editor, I feel like it
  make premade textures instead of text, cause sdl sucks at it... sort of, maybe later
  add a dropdown menu for objects and enemies and whatnot
  add some kind of object editor menu to, well edit objects
Level design
Boss fights




Done stuff
Move menu things from main to MenuState
Create a texture vector pointer thingy to pass to all the children in the land so they may have textures
Create a somewhat functioning PlayState
finish Createing a virtual gameobject to function as a parent for everything
a background object is just a texture thou and textures already exist...
Create a moving player object
floor and walls and ceiling
Collision basics, definitely
colliding with two walls is kinda fixed atm
remember to add the proper parts to the constructor silly
hazard collision basics are done
spike are kind of done i guess, just some damage mechanics are missing
move the hazard collision to somewhere other than the movement
camera movement
animations
  create an animation object that autoruns through the frames
  make a counter(s) similar to iframes and sync that up with the current action
Basic enemies
  Turrets
  Walkers
    can move and see player
    basic ranged ai is existing
Fixed boundary collisions sometimes not registering due to double inaccuracy
jumping and gravity
Player attack
  melee done
Level loader

Discarded ideas:
slopes: not making them, figurev em out later for other projects
